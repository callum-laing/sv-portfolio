<h1>Hey, I'm Callum.</h1>

		I'm a Front-End Web Developer in Cambridge, UK. I have a passion for creating intuitive, dynamic
		and responsive user experiences.

		I don't just code! I play American Football for the Cambridgeshire Cats, I love hiking and
		exploring, and am dad to a beautiful Yorkshire Terrier (picture below for proof).
